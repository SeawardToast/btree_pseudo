WHEN SEARCHING FOR TARGET IN B TREE

subtree i has data that is less than i. subtree i+1 has data greater than i

create local variable i equal to the first index such that data[i] is not less than the target - if no such index exists, set i to data_count
if found target at data[i] then done return true aka item is neither greater than nor less than
else if node has no children then done and return false, the target does not exist
else recursively search subtree[i] for target
